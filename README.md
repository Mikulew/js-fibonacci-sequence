## General info

In mathematics, the **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted F<sub>n</sub> form a sequence, called the **Fibonacci sequence**, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

The sequence starts:

```0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...```

Fibonacci numbers are strongly related to the golden ratio: Binet's formula expresses the *n*th Fibonacci number in terms of n and the golden ratio, and implies that the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers tends to the golden ratio as n increases.
